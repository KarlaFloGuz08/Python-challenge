Description:

In the PyBank challenge, you will analyze financial records from a dataset (budget_data.csv) with two columns: Date and Profit/Loss. 
The goal is to compute various financial metrics to gain insights into the company's performance.

Requirements

- Python 3.
- Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone <repository-url>
- Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
- Place the budget_data.csv file in the project directory.
- Run the script: inside the PyBank folder, the Python script main.py

## Results
The script calculates and outputs the following metrics:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The results look like this:

Description:

The PyPoll challenge focuses on modernizing the vote-counting process for a rural town using a dataset (election_data.csv). 
This dataset has three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The objective is to analyze the voting data and produce a report summarizing the election results.

Requirements

- Python 3.
- Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone <repository-url>
- Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
- Place the election_data.csv file in the project directory.
- Run the script: inside the PyPoll folder,  the Python script main.py


## Results

The script calculates and outputs the following metrics:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on the popular vote

The results look like this:
